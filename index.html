		<p>In the weeks and even months before Kirby and I got married I had trouble of thinking of anything but our wedding.  One thing I often wondered was, "what thoughts will occupy my mind once the wedding is over?"  I really couldn't imagine what I would think about when I didn't have to worry about all of the planning and details.  Well I am here to say that the wedding is now three weeks behind us and I am still thinking about it!  The great thing though is that there are no worries, there is no stress.  I just can't stop thinking about how wonderful it all was.  To have had all of my friends and family there for the most special time in my life was the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me.  Really, its hard to exlain the feelings I have when I think about it all.  Its hard for me to get in a bad mood these days.  I don't want to waste time thinking about things that could bother me.  Thinking about the wedding  is just SO much better.  Thank you to everyone who came.  It was so wonderful to have you there.  I also want to give a HUGE thanks to everyone who helped make the wedding happen, (you know who you are.)  When I think about the amount of help we got especially during the days leading up to the wedding I am overwelmed!  To know that there are so many people who were and are there for Kirby and I is an incredible feeling.  Once again, I don't quite know how to explain how I feel.  I guess I have written enough for now but I feel like I could go on forever.  What a wonderful time and what wonderful memories.  I never want to forget a single second of it.</p>

		<p>3 days remaining?  Only 3 days?  You mean this is really going to happen?  I think something inside just turned over.  You know, that butterfly feeling.  With only 3 days until the big day I better start packing.  Waiting until the last moment will not work for me this time.</p>

																		How we met</TH></TR>
																<TR>
																	<TD>
																		<p>We met for the first time at a Village dive called Down the Hatch during the 
																			early part of 2001. Melanie had come with a mutual friend Shawn who introduced 
																			"Mel" to the girl crazy guys of Avanade. Over the following months, we saw each 
																			other at various happy hours called WIB, Wednesday Is Booze-day. We talked but 
																			nothing more happened.
																		</p>
																		<p>In July, Shawn had organized a group for a Yankee's game. Kirby's friend John 
																			canceled so Shawn called Melanie to see if she could join us. Although last 
																			minute, Melanie was able to cancel her plans and join us for the game. It was 
																			at this game that we really starting talking and got to know each other. The 
																			sparks were flying and the start of new love was in the air.
